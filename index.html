		<h2> MY TRAVELS </h2>
		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
				<h4> 🇯🇵	Japan 🇯🇵</h4>
		<p> During the holiday season, my family and I traveled to Japan to visit my brother. We went to Kyoto, Tokyo, Kamakura and Osaka. I was fascinated by the country and the culture. People are very respectful and quiet. The Japanese culture is one that I am very fond of and I wish to go back to Japan in the future. 
		<p>

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
				<h4> 🇧🇷	Brazil 🇧🇷 </h4>
		<p> My family and I went on a 3-week trip to Brazil a few summers ago. We visited Rio de Janeiro, Iguazù Falls, Manaus & the Amazonian Forest, Jericoacoara and Lençois. Brazil is a country with a very relaxed way of life and beautiful places and views.

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">	
		<h4> 🇺🇸 West Coast 🇺🇸 </h4>
		<p> My family and I visited California and Yellowstone National Park last summer. I particularly liked Yellowstone because the nature and wildlife there is very rich. I loved visitng the west coast but I still prefer the East Coast, maybe because I feel more attached to it :)
		<p>

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
		<h4> 🇮🇩 Bali 🇮🇩 </h4>
		<p> I visited Bali in April of last year. I was struck by how polluted the island was because of the tourisitc activity. Even though the people were very welcoming and the landscapes beautiful, I hope that measures can be taken to preserve this part of the world.  
		<p>

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
		<h4> 🇪🇸 Barcelona 🇪🇸 </h4>
		<p> 
		In 2018, I did an exchange semester in Barcelona. I absolutely loved my experience and the spanish lifestyle. I felt that there was a different atmosphere in Barcelona, very laidback and festive. 💃  
		<p>	
		</div>

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
		<h4> 🇸🇪 Sweden 🇸🇪 </h4>
		<p> 
		I often visit Sweden, especially Stockholm, because my brother and my entire family on my mother's side live there. I am very attached to the Swedish culture and of their good living. 💌
		<p>	
		</div>

		<div class="card-white" id="introduction">
		<h4> 🇩🇪 Germany 🇩🇪 </h4>
		<p> 
		I have been to Germany several times because it was my first language at school. I have been to Munich for an exchange program and to Berlin for a linguistic trip. The german culture reminds me of Sweden sometimes and their food & beer is delicious 🥨🍺
